<h2>What is a Schnitzel?</h2>
<p>In its most basic form, schnitzel is a slice of meat, often pounded until fairly thin, then breaded and fried.<br />
    The dish's name actually comes from the German word schnitt, which translates to "cut".<br />
    The most popular type of meat for schnitzel is veal (wiener-schnitzel) or pork (schweine-schnitzel), but you also
    see varieties made with chicken (h√§nchen-schnitzel), or turkey (puten-schnitzel).

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Veal, pork, chicken, or turkey cutlets (thinly sliced)</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Eggs (beaten)</li>
    <li>Bread crumbs (preferably fresh)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Meat: If the meat is not already thinly sliced, pound it to an even thickness. Season both sides
        with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Set Up Breading Station: Place three shallow dishes side by side. In the first dish, add flour.
        In the second dish, add beaten eggs. In the third dish, add bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Coat the Meat: Dredge each piece of meat in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip it into the beaten eggs,
        ensuring it's fully coated.
        Finally, coat it with the seasoned bread crumbs, pressing the crumbs onto the meat to adhere.</li>
    <li>Fry the Schnitzel: Heat oil in a skillet or pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, carefully add the breaded meat
        and fry until golden brown on both sides.
        The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the meat.</li>
    <li>Drain and Serve: Once cooked, place the schnitzel on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Serve hot,
        garnished with lemon wedges and chopped parsley if desired.</li>
    <li>Optional Accompaniments: Schnitzel is often served with side dishes like mashed potatoes, salad, or a lemon
        wedge for squeezing over the meat.</li>
