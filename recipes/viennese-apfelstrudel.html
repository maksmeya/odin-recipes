<h2>What is Viennese Apfelstrudel?</h2>
<p>Viennese Apfelstrudel, or apple strudel, is a classic Austrian pastry that features a thin, flaky dough filled with a
    delicious spiced apple filling. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
    <li>4-5 large apples (peeled, cored, and thinly sliced)</li>
    <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 cup raisins (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup melted butter (for brushing the top)</li>
    <li>Powdered sugar (for dusting the top)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Dough:: In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, oil, and warm water. Mix until a dough forms.
        Knead the dough on a floured surface until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest for
        about 30 minutes. </li>
    <li>Prepare the Filling: In a bowl, mix the sliced apples, breadcrumbs, sugar, cinnamon, and raisins (if using). Set
        aside.</li>
    <li>Roll out the Dough: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the rested dough on a floured surface into a
        thin sheet. It should be large enough to cover a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Assemble the Strudel: Brush the rolled-out dough with melted butter, leaving about an inch border around the
        edges. Spread the apple filling evenly over the buttered area.</li>
    <li>Roll the Strudel: Starting from one edge, carefully roll the dough with the filling into a log. Place the
        strudel, seam side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Brush and Bake: Brush the top of the strudel with melted butter. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40
        minutes or until the strudel is golden brown and the apples are tender.</li>
    <li>Cool and Serve: Allow the strudel to cool for a bit before slicing. Dust the top with powdered sugar before
        serving.</li>
    <li>Optional: Serve the Apfelstrudel with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a delightful
        treat.</li>
